<strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
All I know is (ooh-ooh-ooh) <br>
We could go anywhere, we could do <br>
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in <br>
All I know is (ooh-ooh-ooh) <br>
Getting lost late at night, under stars <br>
Finding love standing right where we are, your lips <br>
They pull me in the moment, you and I alone and <br>
People may be watching, I don't mind <br>
'Cause <br>

<br><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Anywhere with you feels right<br>
Anywhere with you feels like<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
We don't need a fancy town<br>
Or bottles that we can't pronounce<br>
'Cause anywhere, babe<br>
Is like Paris in the rain<br>
When I'm with you<br>
When I'm with you<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
Paris in the rain<br>

<br><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
I look at you now and I want this forever<br>
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better<br>
Don't know how I ever did it all without you<br>
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest<br>
Feelings they come and they go, that they do<br>
Feelings they come and they go, not with you<br>
The late nights and the street lights and the people<br>
Look at me, girl, and the whole world could stop<br>

<br><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
Anywhere with you feels right<br>
Anywhere with you feels like<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
We don't need a fancy town<br>
Or bottles that we can't pronounce<br>
'Cause anywhere, babe<br>
Is like Paris in the rain<br>
When I'm with you<br>
When I'm with you<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
Paris in the rain (oh)<br>

<br><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
Girl, when I'm not with you<br>
All I do is miss you<br>
So come and set the mood right<br>
Underneath the moonlight<br>
(Days in Paris, nights in Paris)<br>
Paint you with my eyes closed<br>
Wonder where the time goes<br>
(Yeah, isn't it obvious, isn't it obvious?)<br>
Come and set the mood right<br>
Underneath the moonlight<br>

<br><strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
'Cause anywhere with you feel right<br>
Anywhere with you feels like<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
Paris in the rain<br>
Walking down an empty street<br>
Puddles underneath our feet<br>
