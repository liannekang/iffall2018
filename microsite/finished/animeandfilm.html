		<h1>Anime and Film</h1>
			<h2>Anime series</h2>
				<p>
					Pokémon, also known as Pokémon the Series, is an anime television series based on the Pokémon video game series. It was originally broadcast on TV Tokyo in 1997. As of 2018 it has produced and aired over 1,000 episodes, divided into 6 series in Japan and 21 seasons internationally.
				</p>	

				<p> 
					The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in Japan), a Pokémon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends travel around the world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners.
				</p>
				<p>	
				Various children's books, collectively known as Pokémon Junior, are also based on the anime.[35]
				</p>
			<h2>Films</h2>
				<p>
					In addition to the TV series, as of July 2018, 21 animated Pokémon films have been directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Tetsuo Yajima, and distributed in Japan by Toho since 1998. The pair of films, Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram and White—Victini and Zekrom are considered together as one film. Collectibles, such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films.
				</p>
				<h3>Live-action film</h3>
				<p>

It is set for release on May 10, 2019.
				</p>
			<h2>Manga</h2>
				<p>
				There are various Pokémon manga series, four of which were released in English by Viz Media, and seven of them released in English by Chuang Yi. The manga series vary from game-based series to being based on the anime and the Trading Card Game. Original stories have also been published. As there are several series created by different authors, most Pokémon manga series differ greatly from each other and other media, such as the anime.[citation needed] Pokémon Pocket Monsters and Pokémon Adventures are the two manga in production since the first generation.
